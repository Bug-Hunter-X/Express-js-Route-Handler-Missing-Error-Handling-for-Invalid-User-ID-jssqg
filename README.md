# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  missing error handling for invalid input. Specifically, the code attempts to parse a user ID from a route parameter without checking if it's a valid integer. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the ID is not a number.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. The route handler attempts to find a user based on the ID provided in the route parameter. However, it does not handle cases where the ID is not a number, which will result in `parseInt(userId)` returning `NaN`, leading to a failure to find the user even if a user with that ID exists, or a runtime error if `users` is not an array.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code.  It includes checks to ensure the user ID is a valid number before attempting to parse and use it. It also handles the case where no user is found, returning an appropriate 404 status code.
